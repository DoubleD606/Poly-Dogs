Well first of all if it isn't ovbious you need a VR for this, i know it works on the quest 2 and im assuming it works on the quest 1 and 3 and probably quest pro but i dunno
for other VR's if you can play GTag on them you can probably play this game "IF" you are able to download and open APKs

if you have a quest 2 i would recomend this Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tau63RyAIoc but if that doesn't help try googling "How to download APKs to (insert vr name here) (insert with/without pc here)"
